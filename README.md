# Vaso Programming Language 🥃

> **"Simple as a spoon, Fast as a rocket."**

Vaso is a next-generation programming language designed to unify high-level simplicity with low-level hardware control. It introduces a novel **5-state logic system (Quantum-Ready)** and seamless multi-language interoperability.

## 🚀 Key Features

- **Hybrid Syntax:** Write code as simple as Python or as controlled as C++.
- **The "Chameleon" Bridge:** Native support to embed other languages directly:
  ```vaso
  use(python): {
      import numpy as np
      # ... seamless execution
  }

V-Bit Logic (Quantum Ready): Native support for 5-state logic (No, Yes, Unknown, Paradox, Null) for advanced AI and fuzzy logic implementation.

Hardware Agnostic: Optimizes automatically for CPU or GPU (RTX/CUDA) without complex configurations.

## Installation
(Coming Soon - Pre-Alpha Version)

## Example

// file: main.vs
use std.io;

fn main() {
    // 1. Simplicity
    val message := "Hello World from Vaso";
    print(message);

    // 2. The Power of V-Bit (5-state logic)
    val status : vbit = 2; // State: Unknown/Probable
    
    if status == 2 {
        print("Status is uncertain. Initiating deep check...");
    }
}
